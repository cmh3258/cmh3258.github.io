			<p class="text-gray-600 text-[20px] leading-5">
				"Chris has been such a great asset to the team this year. Chris continues to be quick and efficient with his development features. We are always on the hunt for more tickets to keep him busy and not waiting for more work."

				"Chris is an exceptional engineer with a proactive approach to enhancing tasks beyond their immediate scope. He demonstrates foresight in anticipating challenges and effectively collaborates by seeking clarification when needed.

				Also, commendable improvements in maintaining JIRA stories, ensuring clarity and organization for stakeholders.
				
				These are just some of the many reasons Chris is enjoyable to work with and I hope to work with him on future projects!"

				"Chris started out 2024 super strong by really stepping up to close out the project. He squashed a series of bugs and implemented several last minute feature requests rapidly and with little guidance. He also took initiative and identified quite a few improvements that could be made and closed those out as well. We couldn't have closed out that project so quickly without him."

				"Chris is an exceptional engineer, who takes initiative and isn't scared to add voice to difficult situations. He is relaxed and easy going and an absolute pleasure to work with. His quality of work is exceptional, intuitively knowing how to add value quick.
				On my dream team, he definitely has a spot."

				"Chris excels with his sharp frontend skills, particularly on the UI front. He was able to quickly build out pixel-perfect components, and adapt to new frameworks and libraries thrown his way. He also excelled in being an all-around presence on the team - with regular code reviews, clear communication, and adaptability."
